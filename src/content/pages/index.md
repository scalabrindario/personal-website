Dario grew up in a family of entrepreneurs in the north of Italy, which nurtured his curiosity towards innovation and technology.

He studied in one of the largest Italian Innovation Hubs and worked in a Global Fortune 500 company. These experiences fostered the creation of an open-minded and risk-taker young man, who believes in the power of *"doing what is right, not what is easy"*.
